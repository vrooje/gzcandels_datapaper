{\notebsm To be rewritten, probably last.}

Galaxies are sometimes really far away. The distant ones are pretty cool, because they tell us what the Universe was like back when it was just a kid, or maybe a teenager. You really have to look hard to see these galaxies, but once you do, what you do see tells you a whole lot. I mean, it's not exactly a WYSIWYG type of thing: there's a lot of work to figure out what the faint stuff you see really means. We did a bunch of work, and we think we did pretty well. Also, we compared to others who have done different kinds of work to try and answer some of the same questions. But we have a unique way of answering them, so here are those answers, and you can use them to answer other questions about the Universe.

{\notebsm Outline:}\\
Galaxy morphologies trace physics \& dynamics and are therefore important.

They have a long history and there are many types, including those that use proxies [which are useful but not without problems] and those that reduce a galaxy and its billions of stars to a single number [same]. Visual morphologies are in many ways still ideal as they are able to provide incredibly detailed information about galaxies.

Visual morphologies have a scale problem without many eyes, and they're often not quantified. Galaxy Zoo to the rescue.

Galaxy Zoo started in 2007 and has provided robust, quantified visual classifications for more than 1,000,000 galaxies to $z \sim 1$. 

Much use has been made of these, including [summarize and include non-GZ papers].

Here we present the visual morphologies of galaxies imaged by the $HST$ treasury survey CANDELS.

\subsection{Images}\label{sec:images}

% Note this is lifted directly from the bar paper so I should probably mix it up a bit later
The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Extragalactic Legacy Survey \citep[CANDELS;][]{grogin11,koekemoer11} is an \emph{HST} Treasury programme combining optical and near-infrared imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (infrared channel; WFC3/IR) across five well-studied survey fields {(GOODS-North and -South, \citeauthor{giavalisco04} \citeyear{giavalisco04}; EGS, \citeauthor{davis07} \citeyear{davis07}; UDS, \citeauthor{lawrence07} \citeyear{lawrence07}, \citeauthor{cirasuolo07} \citeyear{cirasuolo07}; and COSMOS, \citeauthor{scoville07} \citeyear{scoville07}) using a two-tiered ``deep'' and ``wide'' approach. Each of the wide fields (UDS, COSMOS, EGS and flanking fields to the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields) are imaged over 2 orbits in WFC3/IR, split in a 2:1 ratio between filters F160W and F125W, respectively, with parallel exposures in F606W and F814W using ACS. Each of the deep fields (GOODS-S and GOODS-N) are imaged over at least 4 orbits each in both the F160W and F125W filters and 3 orbits in the F105W filter, with ACS exposures in F606W and F814W in parallel. These are reduced and combined to produce a single mosaic for each field in each band, with drizzled resolutions of $0.03^{\prime\prime}$ and $0.06^{\prime\prime}$ per pixel for ACS and WFC3/IR, respectively \citep[a process described in detail by][]{koekemoer11}.

Here we use the CANDELS ACS and WFC3/IR images from within the first set of data to be classified within the Galaxy Zoo interface. Those data cover the COSMOS, GOODS-South, and UDS fields. The 4th release of Galaxy Zoo included all detections with $H \leq 25.5$ from these 3 combined fields, comprising 49,555 unique images. These were shown to visitors to the website galaxyzoo.org{\footnote{Archived at zoo4.galaxyzoo.org}} starting on the 10th of September, 2012.  

The images shown to the public are colour composites of ACS $I$ ($F814W$), WFC3 $J$ ($F125W$), and WFC3 $H$ ($F160W$) filters for the blue, green and red channels, respectively. The angular sizes of the images in different filters are matched, and the native point-spread functions (PSFs) are used. The images are combined with an asinh stretch \citep[described in detail in][]{luptonasinh} with a non-linearity value of {\notebsm 3.0}. 

Sources in the dataset vary greatly in size and surface brightness, and therefore a single set of values for channel scalings is not adequate to capture the variety of features across the images. We therefore use a variable scaling based on the {\notebsm magnitude and size} of each target source. For each image the R, G, and B channels have a fixed ratio of {\notebsm [not sure; must get this from Jeyhan]}, and the multiplier can vary between {\notebsm A and B}. Figure \ref{fig:imageexamples} shows examples of these colour composites across a wide range of source fluxes and sizes. 

Each colour image is 424 pixels square. The angular size of the image varies, such that the colour image encompasses at least {\notebsm 3 times the 80\% flux radius of the target source}, with a minimum screen-to-WFC3 zoom ratio of {\notebsm 1:10} and a maximum ratio of {\notebsm 3:1}. The Galaxy Zoo interface loads the normal colour images by default, and the user may choose to display an inverted colour image, but may not otherwise change the image scaling or size within the software while performing the classification.



\subsection{Photometry}

Brief description of photometric catalogs. Focus on $IJH$ because that's all the images consider. Do mention all the extra stuff available, but note that the classifications themselves don't depend on them.
%The debiasing will, though, because the photometric redshifts do.



\subsection{Redshifts}\label{sec:z}

Some of them have speczs. Lots of them have photzs, including CANDELS, 3D-HST and several previous surveys.
%I'm thinking the first thing to do is pick a redshift for all the sources, and settle on it, before any other analysis proceeds.
%Also it would be helpful to match each ID we use to the CANDELS unique ID that the team uses. Even if we don't publish it.

Comparison of photozs and speczs; might be able to just reference the other papers.

What do we do about those without redshifts? We use them with caution, I guess.



\subsection{Simulated Images}\label{sec:ferengi}

Describe simulations and what we'll use them for.

This selection was made independently of restrictions on redshift or luminosity (a full description of the sample selection is given in Section \ref{sec:sample}). Eight independent classifiers subsequently examined each of the 876 disk galaxies for evidence of a bar.

\subsection{Raw classifications}

Basic details on raw classifications, including the start and end dates considered in this paper, how many classifications which galaxies have, why some have less than others and some more. 

How many users participated, and the distribution of classifications (typical number per person, number signed in and not, maybe that square diagram Old Weather uses).
