\begin{abstract}

Galaxies are sometimes really far away. The distant ones are pretty cool, because they tell us what the Universe was like back when it was just a kid, or maybe a teenager. You really have to look hard to see these galaxies, but once you do, what you do see tells you a whole lot. I mean, it's not exactly a WYSIWYG type of thing: there's a lot of work to figure out what the faint stuff you see really means. We did a bunch of work, and we think we did pretty well. Also, we compared to others who have done different kinds of work to try and answer some of the same questions. But we have a unique way of answering them, so here are those answers, and you can use them to answer other questions about the Universe.

\subsection{Images}\label{sec:images}

Description of CANDELS.

Description of imaging, including wide vs deep and magnitude limits.

How images were made: stretch, exact parameters, zoom, etc.

Note the difference between the number of subjects and the number of galaxies -- because some images went in at 2 depths.



\subsection{Photometry}

Brief description of photometric catalogs. Focus on $IJH$ because that's all the images consider. Do mention all the extra stuff available, but note that the classifications themselves don't depend on them.
%The debiasing will, though, because the photometric redshifts do.



\subsection{Redshifts}\label{sec:z}

Some of them have speczs. Lots of them have photzs, including CANDELS, 3D-HST and several previous surveys.
%I'm thinking the first thing to do is pick a redshift for all the sources, and settle on it, before any other analysis proceeds.
%Also it would be helpful to match each ID we use to the CANDELS unique ID that the team uses. Even if we don't publish it.

Comparison of photozs and speczs; might be able to just reference the other papers.

What do we do about those without redshifts? We use them with caution, I guess.



\subsection{Simulated Images}\label{sec:ferengi}

Describe simulations and what we'll use them for.

%\emph{Left:} Partial Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS classification tree, starting with the first question (top) and leading to the bar feature question. There are 17 questions total in the tree; the bar question is a 4th-tier task. \emph{Right:} Selection of the featured, not-edge-on disk galaxy sample (876 galaxies) in GZ-CANDELS; relative box areas are scaled to the sample sizes. This selection was made independently of restrictions on redshift or luminosity (a full description of the sample selection is given in Section \ref{sec:sample}). Eight independent classifiers subsequently examined each of the 876 disk galaxies for evidence of a bar.

%%%%% END FIGURE %%%%%

Details on the decision tree, plus a table mapping questions and answers to unique tasks and answers, like the one in Willett et al. 2013.



\subsection{Raw classifications}

Basic details on raw classifications, including the start and end dates considered in this paper, how many classifications which galaxies have, why some have less than others and some more. 

How many users participated, and the distribution of classifications (typical number per person, number signed in and not, maybe that square diagram Old Weather uses). 



\subsection{User Weighting}

Note: we may discuss other weighting if that proves useful.
