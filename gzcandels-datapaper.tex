{\notebsm To be rewritten, probably last.}

Galaxies are sometimes really far away. The distant ones are pretty cool, because they tell us what the Universe was like back when it was just a kid, or maybe a teenager. You really have to look hard to see these galaxies, but once you do, what you do see tells you a whole lot. I mean, it's not exactly a WYSIWYG type of thing: there's a lot of work to figure out what the faint stuff you see really means. We did a bunch of work, and we think we did pretty well. Also, we compared to others who have done different kinds of work to try and answer some of the same questions. But we have a unique way of answering them, so here are those answers, and you can use them to answer other questions about the Universe.

{\notebsm Outline:}\\
Galaxy morphologies trace physics \& dynamics and are therefore important.

They have a long history and there are many types, including those that use proxies [which are useful but not without problems] and those that reduce a galaxy and its billions of stars to a single number [same]. Visual morphologies are in many ways still ideal as they are able to provide incredibly detailed information about galaxies.

Visual morphologies have a scale problem without many eyes, and they're often not quantified. Galaxy Zoo to the rescue.

Galaxy Zoo started in 2007 and has provided robust, quantified visual classifications for more than 1,000,000 galaxies to $z \sim 1$. 

Much use has been made of these, including [summarize and include non-GZ papers].

Here we present the visual morphologies of galaxies imaged by the $HST$ treasury survey CANDELS.

\subsection{Images}\label{sec:images}

% Note this is lifted directly from the bar paper so I should probably mix it up a bit later
The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Extragalactic Legacy Survey \citep[CANDELS;][]{grogin11,koekemoer11} is an \emph{HST} Treasury programme combining optical and near-infrared imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (infrared channel; WFC3/IR) across five well-studied survey fields {(GOODS-North and -South, \citeauthor{giavalisco04} \citeyear{giavalisco04}; EGS, \citeauthor{davis07} \citeyear{davis07}; UDS, \citeauthor{lawrence07} \citeyear{lawrence07}, \citeauthor{cirasuolo07} \citeyear{cirasuolo07}; and COSMOS, \citeauthor{scoville07} \citeyear{scoville07}) using a two-tiered ``deep'' and ``wide'' approach. Each of the wide fields (UDS, COSMOS, EGS and flanking fields to the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields) are imaged over 2 orbits in WFC3/IR, split in a 2:1 ratio between filters F160W and F125W, respectively, with parallel exposures in F606W and F814W using ACS. Each of the deep fields (GOODS-S and GOODS-N) are imaged over at least 4 orbits each in both the F160W and F125W filters and 3 orbits in the F105W filter, with ACS exposures in F606W and F814W in parallel. These are reduced and combined to produce a single mosaic for each field in each band, with drizzled resolutions of $0.03^{\prime\prime}$ and $0.06^{\prime\prime}$ per pixel for ACS and WFC3/IR, respectively \citep[a process described in detail by][]{koekemoer11}.

Here we use the CANDELS ACS and WFC3/IR images from within the first set of data to be classified within the Galaxy Zoo interface. Those data cover the COSMOS, GOODS-South, and UDS fields. The 4th release of Galaxy Zoo included all detections with $H \leq 25.5$ from these 3 combined fields, comprising 49,555 unique images. These were shown to visitors to the website galaxyzoo.org{\footnote{Archived at zoo4.galaxyzoo.org}} starting on the 10th of September, 2012.  

The images shown to the public are colour composites of ACS $I$ ($F814W$), WFC3 $J$ ($F125W$), and WFC3 $H$ ($F160W$) filters for the blue, green and red channels, respectively. The angular sizes of the images in different filters are matched, and the native point-spread functions (PSFs) are used. The images are combined with an asinh stretch \citep[described in detail in][]{luptonasinh} with a non-linearity value of {\notebsm 3.0}. 

Sources in the dataset vary greatly in size and surface brightness, and therefore a single set of values for channel scalings is not adequate to capture the variety of features across the images. We therefore use a variable scaling based on the {\notebsm magnitude and size} of each target source. For each image the R, G, and B channels have a fixed ratio of {\notebsm [not sure; must get this from Jeyhan]}, and the multiplier can vary between {\notebsm A and B}. Figure \ref{fig:imageexamples} shows examples of these colour composites across a wide range of source fluxes and sizes. 

Each colour image is 424 pixels square. The angular size of the image varies, such that the colour image encompasses at least {\notebsm 3 times the 80\% flux radius of the target source}, with a minimum screen-to-WFC3 zoom ratio of {\notebsm 1:10} and a maximum ratio of {\notebsm 3:1}. The Galaxy Zoo interface loads the normal colour images by default, and the user may choose to display an inverted colour image, but may not otherwise change the image scaling or size within the software while performing the classification.



\subsection{Photometry}


Brief description of photometric catalogs. Focus on $IJH$ because that's all the images consider. Do mention all the extra stuff available, but note that the classifications themselves don't depend on them.
%The debiasing will, though, because the photometric redshifts do.



\subsection{Redshifts}\label{sec:z}

Some of them have speczs. Lots of them have photzs, including CANDELS, 3D-HST and several previous surveys.
%I'm thinking the first thing to do is pick a redshift for all the sources, and settle on it, before any other analysis proceeds.
%Also it would be helpful to match each ID we use to the CANDELS unique ID that the team uses. Even if we don't publish it.

Comparison of photozs and speczs; might be able to just reference the other papers.

What do we do about those without redshifts? We use them with caution?

\subsection{Calibration and Simulated Images}

Mention the duplicated images in GDS, which were put in both identically (this was by accident - so we got double each of these and can theoretically check the variance in classifications, but that's kind of a stupid justification and I'm not quite sure how to mention these without saying "oopsies") and at 2-epoch depth (though this has not actually happened yet so I may need to just leave it out). Also it'd be nice to mention the FERENGIfied images, but ... those aren't in yet either. Basically, the only reason to have this section at the moment is to say "oops".

\subsection{Decision Tree}

%%%%% [FIGURE: Example images] %%%%%
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{candels_classification_tree_withlabels_new.eps}
\caption{
The Decision Tree for Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS
}
\label{fig:tree}
\end{figure*}
%%%%% END FIGURE %%%%%

The goal of Galaxy Zoo CANDELS is to provide detailed quantitative visual morphologies of galaxies observed by the deepest, most complete \emph{HST} multi-wavelength legacy survey to date. 
%The classification interface was designed first and foremost with this goal in mind. 
There are many morphological features of interest, including both broad questions about a galaxy's overall appearance and more detailed questions about specific features. 

We employ a tree-based structure for collecting information on these morphological features, a strategy that has been used successfully in both Galaxy Zoo 2 {\notebsm (refs here)} and Galaxy Zoo: Hubble {\notebsm (and here)}. The decision tree, shown visually in Figure \ref{fig:tree}, first asks the classifier to choose between the broad categories of "smooth and rounded", "features or disk", and "star or artifact". The next question either exits the classification (if the classifier has indicated the image is of a star or artifact) or asks for further details about the galaxy. 

When the classifier has indicated in the first question that the galaxy has features or a disk, a series of follow-up questions are asked about features such as clumps, spiral patterns, bulge strength, and the presence of a bar. When the classifier has indicated the galaxy is mostly smooth and rounded, the next question asks them to rate the overall roundedness, a question roughly corresponding to an axis ratio measurement. Finally, when the classifier has finished answering all follow-up questions about either the "smooth" or "featured" galaxy, they are then asked whether the galaxy is undergoing a merger, has tidal tails, or has both, or neither.

The tree-based structure has a number of advantages. First, it focuses the classifier on a single feature at a time, highlighting each feature. This is a deliberate attempt to reset the attention of the classifier with each new question and avoid the biases that may result when a person is presented with a large number of decision tasks at once, including  {\notebsm (references for inattentional blindness and overchoice)}. 

Second, the tree-based structure is especially optimal for an interface which may collect classifications from users who have never before seen an image of a galaxy. With each question, the classifier may display a series of "Help" images that show different examples of the feature the question is asking about. 

{\notebsm Other advantages we should mention?}

The disadvantage of a tree-based classification structure concerns the dependencies introduced into the vote fractions by such a structure. A classifier cannot, for example, answer that the same galaxy has both a mostly smooth appearance and also has a spiral feature. This is in some ways an advantage, as it prevents contradictory and unphysical classifications, but it also means that an analysis of  morphological vote fractions with the goal of examining spiral galaxies must account for the fact that whether a given classifier reached the spiral branch of the decision tree depends on their answer to the questions preceding it. 

Accounting for dependencies of questions in deeper branches of the decision tree on higher-level questions is, however, a manageable task which has been undertaken successfully in many previous studies of specific galaxy structural features {\notebsm {for specific examples, see [citation bomb here]}}. 

The Galaxy Zoo CANDELS decision tree is shown in visual form in Figure \ref{fig:tree} and in text form in Table \ref{table:tree}. We note that this tree is most similar to the tree used in the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble project \citep[shown in ][]{melvin14} {\notebsm (note to self to check that the full tree is actually shown there}, which also has an additional branch identifying clumpy galaxies and focusing on the detailed structure of galaxy clumps. There are small differences, however: for example, Task 10, the question about a bulge in an edge-on disk, is a Yes/No question here, whereas in previous iterations of the decision tree this question also asked whether the bulge shape was rounded or boxy. Additionally, the final question in the tree (Task 16) is substantially different from previous versions and is here only concerned with galaxy mergers and tidal features. 

After the classification of each image is finished, the classifier is asked "{\notebsm Do you want to discuss this galaxy?}" If the classifier selects "No", a new image is shown for classification. If the classifier selects yes, a new window opens with a discussion page focused on the image they have just classified. Within this part of the Galaxy Zoo software, users may ask questions and make comments on specific images, or engage in more general discussions. Users may also "tag" images and discussions using a format identical to Twitter's hashtag system. Some of these tags were used in the pre-analysis of Galaxy Zoo CANDELS data, on which more details are given in Section \ref{sec:dunno} below.


\subsection{Raw classifications}

% First classification 2012-09-10 18:41:25 UTC, last classification 2013-11-30 12:58:51 UTC
% NOTE I've just discovered that people who put commas in their usernames can mess up my (admittedly simple and awk-based) system of separating classifications. SO THAT IS JUST TOTES AWESOME THEN
% So I *think* the total number of classifications is 2,149,206 but I'm not completely sure yet. @#$^@^#T%&@*$O(LT*Ur
The first classification on the Galaxy Zoo interface\footnote{zoo4.galaxyzoo.org} was registered on the 10th of September 2012. The final classification considered here, in the first phase of Galaxy Zoo CANDELS, was registered on the 30th of November 2013. Between these times, the site collected 2,149,206 classifications of 52,076 subjects from {\notebsm USERCOUNT} users.

Subjects from within the full list of images were chosen randomly, with the initial goal of obtaining at least 40 independent classifications for each galaxy. 
%However, as the subject list was chosen to be inclusive of relatively faint sources, we performed an interim analysis all detected galaxies with WFC3 magnitudes $H < 25.5$, which is relatively faint for extended sources



Basic details on raw classifications, including the start and end dates considered in this paper, how many classifications which galaxies have, why some have less than others and some more. 

How many users participated, and the distribution of classifications (typical number per person, number signed in and not, maybe that square diagram Old Weather uses).
